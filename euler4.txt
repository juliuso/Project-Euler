A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91  99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

1. Minimum number = 100.
2. Maximum number = 999.
3. Operation is * (multiplication)
4. The operands can be the same (eg. 123 * 123)
5. The Minimum product is 10,000
6. The Maximum product is 998,001
7. A palindrome can be read the same both left-to-right and right-to-left.

Solution

1. All possible products are calculated, and placed into a list.
2. if list[i]==list.reverse([i]):
	list.append(palindromes)

for i in allProducts:
	if (i==allProducts.reverse(i)):
		palindromes.append(i)

print max(palindromes)
